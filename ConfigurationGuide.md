# Visual Asset Management System(VAMS) - Configuration

VAMS backend allows for basic to advanced configuration based on the environment and use-case need.

Configuration files can be found in `/infra/config` with `config.json` being the primary file used during deployment. Additional config template files exist for common environment setups for Commercial or GovCloud deployments.

Recommended minimum fields to update are `region`, `adminEmailAddress`, and `baseStackName` when using the default provided templates.

Some configuration options can be overriden at time of deployment with either environment variables or cdk context parameters (--context X) used with `cdk deploy`

## Configuration Options

-   `name` | default: vams | #Base application name to use in the full CDK stack name

-   `env.account` | default: NULL | #AWS Account to use for CDK deployment. If null, pulled from CDK environment.
-   `env.region` | default: us-east-1 | #AWS Region to use for CDK deployment. If null, pulled from CDK environment.
-   `env.loadContextIgnoreVPCStacks` | default: false | #Mode to ignore synth and deployments of any nested stack that needs a VPC in order to first load context through a first synth run.

-   `app.baseStackName` | default: prod | #Base stack stage environment name to use when creating full CDK stack name.
-   `app.adminUserId` | default: < administrator > | #Administrator username to use for the initial super admin account. This can also be in the form of an email address.
-   `app.adminEmailAddress` | default: < adminEmail@example.com > | #Administrator email address to use for the initial super admin account. A temporary password will be sent here for an initial solution standup.

### Additional configuration notes

-   `Gov Cloud` - This will check for Use Global VPC, Use ALB, Use OpenSearch Provisioned, and Use Location Services. Additionally does some small implementation changes for components that are different in GovCloud partitions.
-   `Gov Cloud - IL6 Compliant` - This will check for Use Cognito, Use WAF, Use VPC for all Lambdas, and Use KMS CMK Encryption. Additionally does some small implementation changes for components that are different in GovCloud IL6 partition.
-   `OpenSearch` - If both serverless and provisioned are not enabled, no OpenSearch will be enabled which will reduce the functionality in the application to not have any search capabilities on assets. All authorized assets will be returned always on the assets page.
-   `OpenSearch - Provisioned` - This service is very sensitive to VPC Subnet Availabilty Zone selection. If using an external VPC, make sure the provided private subnets are a minimum of 3 and are each in their own availability zone. OpenSearch Provisioned CDK creates service-linked roles althoguh sometimes these don't get recognized right away during a first-time deployment by receiving the following error: `Invalid request provided: Before you can proceed, you must enable a service-linked role to give Amazon OpenSearch Service permissions to access your VPC.`. Wait 5 minutes minutes after your first run and then re-run your deployment (after clearing out any previous stack in CloudFormation). If you continue seeing issues, run the following CLI command manually to try to create these roles by hand: `aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name es.amazonaws.com`, `aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name opensearchservice.amazonaws.com`

-   `Global VPC` - Will auto be enabled if ALB, OpenSearch Provisioned, or Use-case Pipelines is enabled. OpenSearch Serverless endpoints and associated lambdas will also be put behind the VPC if toggling on the VPC and using for all lambdas.
-   -   IPs Used per Feature:
-   -   ALB: 8 IPs per subnet (public or private) [needs up to 8 during runtime to scale, may be less during low-use]
-   -   Use-case Pipelines: ~2 IPs per subnet deployed running an active pipeline workflow execution (based on application demand)
-   -   Lambda in VPC: 1 IP per deployed CDK lambda functions per subnet (v2.0: ~66)
-   -   VPC Interface Endpoints: 1 IP per endpoint per subnet (based on overall configuration needs, see `Global VPC Endpoints` below)
-   `Global VPC Subnets` - Each Subnet to subnet-type (relevent to public or private) used should reside in it's own AZ within the region. Subnets should be configured for IPv4. CDK will probably deploy/create to the amount of AZs and related subnets. When importing an existing VPC/subnets, make sure each subnet provided is located within its own AZ (otherwise errors may occur). The minimum amount of AZs/Subnets needed are (use the higher number): 3 - when using Open Search Provisioned, 2 - when using ALB, 1 - for all other configurations. Reccomended to have at least 128 IPs (IPv4) available per subnet for deployment to support current VAMS usage (max configuration) and growth.
-   `Global VPC Endpoints` - When using a Global VPC, interface/gateway endpoints are needed. The following is the below chart of VPC Endpoints created (when using addVpcEndpoints config option) or are needed otherwise. Some endpoints have special creation conditions that are noted below.
-   -   (Interface) KMS - Deployed/used with Use KMS CMK Encryption Features
-   -   (Interface) KMS FIPS - Deployed/used with Use KMS CMK Encryption and Use FIPS Features
-   -   (Interface) ECR - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) ECR Docker - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-casePipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) CloudWatch Logs - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) SNS - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) SFN - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) Bedrock Runtime - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) Rekognition - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Use-case Pipeline Features
-   -   (Interface) SSM - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" and Open Search Provisioned Features
-   -   (Interface) Lambda - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" Feature
-   -   (Interface) STS - Deployed/used with "Use with All Lambda" Feature
-   -   (Interface) Batch - Deployed/used with Use-case Pipeline Feature
-   -   (Interface) OpenSearch Serverless - Deployed/used with OpenSearch Serverless Feature
-   -   (Interface) S3 (ALB-Special) - Created on VPC when using ALB as it's specially setup with the ALB IPs and targets. Separate configuration option to create this under the ALB setting.
-   -   (Gateway) S3 - Due to no pricing implications, deployed/used across all features that require VPC
-   -   (Gateway) DynamoDB - Due to no pricing implications, deployed/used across all features that require VPC

-   `KMS Encryption - External CMK` - When importing an external CMK KMS key to use for encryption the VAMS deployment, ensure the CMK key is located in the same region as the deployment and has the following permissions.
-   -   Actions: `["kms:GenerateDataKey*", "kms:Decrypt", "kms:ReEncrypt*", "kms:DescribeKey",  "kms:ListKeys", "kms:CreateGrant"]`
-   -   Resources: `["*"]`
-   -   Principals: `S3, DYNAMODB, STS, SQS, SNS, ECS, ECS_TASKS, LOGS, LAMBDA, CLOUDFRONT, ES, AOSS` - Note: ES: OpenSearch Provisioned, AOSS - OpenSearch Serverless

-   `Asset Buckets` - If `app.assetBuckets.createNewBucket` is set to false, you must define at least one external asset bucket in `app.assetBuckets.externalAssetBuckets`. Each external bucket configuration requires a bucketArn, baseAssetsPrefix, and defaultSyncDatabaseId.

### Misc Troubleshooting

-   `Global VPC External Import` + `Global VPC Endpoints` - if you receive a stack deployment error like `route table rtb-XXXX already has a route with destination-prefix-list-id pl-XXXXX`, this means your VPC you have provided already has some of the VPC endpoints created and/or route table entries for those services.
-   -   Turn `app.useGlobalVpc.addVpcEndpoints` to `false` and manually add any missing endpoints based on the endpoints listed in the additional configuration notes.
-   -   Note that the ALB endpoint (if using an ALB) is always auto-created regardless of this flag. If this errors, you may have to manually modify the VAMS CDK code to not add this endpoint and by hand add/update ALB targets with the endpoint IPs.
-   `ALB Enabled` - if you receive a stack deployment error like `'Properties validation failed for resource WebAppWebAppALBTargetGroupXXXXX with message: #/Targets: array items are not unique'`, this unforuntaely means that AWS CloudFormation had an unexpected and rare hiccup when trying to set the VPC S3 Interface endpoint IPs to the ALB target. This can happen every once in a while and the cause has yet to be identified.
-   -   No changes are needed. Re-run the stack deployment to mitigate.

## Additional Configuration Environment Options

Additional deployment environment configuration settings can be set in the `./infra/cdk.json` file.

Any non-empty-key key-value-pair in `{environments: {common: {}}}` will be added as tags on all assets deployed in the VAMS Core stack.

The following additional settings can be added under `{environments: {aws: {}}}`:

-   `PermissionBoundaryArn` - If Permission Boundary ARN defined, applies the Permission boundary to apply to all roles created by VAMS Core stack.
-   `IamRoleNamePrefix` - If role name prefix string defined, applies the prefix in front of all newly created roles by VAMS Core stack. Warning: The total role name character count limit is 64 so long prefixes may affect rolename uniqueness and cause deployment issues. Reccomend prefixs no longer than 8 characters.

## Additional Configuration Policy Options

Additional IAM and resource permission policies can be added to AWS components created to further lock down or open up a component.

An empty file means no additional policy statement will be added besides the default security restrictions. Currently only a single statement to add is supported.

The `./infra/config/policy/s3AdditionalBucketPolicyConfig.json` allows you to add a additional JSON-formated IAM policy statement that will get added to all S3 buckets created. This also controls the ability to ALLOW or DENY access to PreSigned S3 URLS and STS credentials that are generated by VAMS for Asset Upload and Download. Note: Resource will be overriden at deployment run-time to include each respective bucket and their objects.

Some example policy statements are below based on <https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/block-s3-traffic-vpc-ip>. Recomend adding `aws:ViaAWSService` condition as `false` to restrict only on direct user calls as services will also need to access these buckets.

Example: Restrict access outside of a VPC Interface Endpoint (fill in existing VPC Interface Endpoint ID)

```
{
    "Sid": "VPCe",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Resource": ["*"],
    "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
        "aws:SourceVpce": [
        "vpce-XXXXXXXX",
        "vpce-YYYYYYYY"
        ]
    },
    "BoolIfExists": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "false"}
    },
    "Principal": "*"
}
```

Example: Restrict access outside of a VPC Private IP (Fill in IP addresses and/or CIDR ranges)

```
{
    "Sid": "VpcSourceIp",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Resource": ["*"],
    "Condition": {
    "NotIpAddressIfExists": {
        "aws:VpcSourceIp": [
        "10.1.1.1/32",
        "172.1.1.1/32"
        ]
    },
    "BoolIfExists": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "false"}
    },
    "Principal": "*"
}
```

Example: Restrict access outside of a source IP (Fill in IP addresses and/or CIDR ranges)

```
{
    "Sid": "SourceIP",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Resource": ["*"],
    "Condition": {
    "NotIpAddressIfExists": {
        "aws:SourceIp": [
        "11.11.11.11/32",
        "22.22.22.22/32"
        ]
    },
    "BoolIfExists": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "false"}
    },
    "Principal": "*"
}
```

## Cloudfront TLS 1.2 Enforcement

Amazon CloudFront is deployed using the default CloudFront domain name and TLS certificate. To use a later TLS version (1.2), use your own custom domain name and custom SSL certificate. For more information, refer to using alternate domain names and HTTPS in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

This is a post-configuration option or modification to the CDK and not a feature currently available as part of the VAMS CDK Configuration. Domains are currently only supported as part of VAMS CDK configuration with a web ALB deployment.
